# GaussianSplattingUnity (WIP)
Attempt at creating a 3D Gaussian Splatting visualizer in Unity, based on the Web visualizer by **https://github.com/cvlab-epfl/gaussian-splatting-web**
Original work: https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting

- [x] Ply Loader and Data structure for Gaussians
- [x] Rendering Quads in the GPU, in the repective Gaussian positions
- [x] Definition of all methods
- [x] Basic Structure
- [ ] Sorting Gaussians by Depth
- [ ] Debugging (making it work)
