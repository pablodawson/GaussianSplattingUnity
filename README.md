# GaussianSplattingUnity (WIP)
Attempt at creating a 3D Gaussian Splatting visualizer in Unity, based on the Web visualizer by **https://github.com/cvlab-epfl/gaussian-splatting-web**
Original work: https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting

It uses **Graphics.RenderPrimitivesIndexed** to render Quads by GPU instancing.
It currently crashes at init.

- [x] Ply Loader and Data structure for storing Gaussians
- [x] Rendering Quads via GPU instancing in the Gaussian positions
- [x] Code Structure
- [ ] Methods
- [ ] Sorting Gaussians by Depth
- [ ] Fix bugs (making it not crash/work)
